                <p>
                    Pasta (US: /ˈpɑːstə/, UK: /ˈpæstə/; Italian pronunciation: [ˈpasta]) is an Italian type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs,
                    and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.
                    Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative.
                    Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.

                    A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, 
                    or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type.
                    The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. 
                    The 3rd of November marks the National Sandwich Day.
